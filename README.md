The platform will have a login system where the user can verify the authenticity of the product/consignment recieved by scanning a QR Code that'll contain the details upto that point in the lifecycle. This user wiill update the details, generate a new code and forward the new details._

#### Usage

_Users can scan QR Codes from the scanner on the first page by uploading images of QR Codes. A JSON file is returned which contains the details about the product from its inception, upto that point in the supply chain. Nodes in supply chain which aren't end users can also update the QR Codes and add new information to it using the edit page._
